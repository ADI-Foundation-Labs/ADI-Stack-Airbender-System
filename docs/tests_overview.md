# Test Suites – Circuits & Proof System

Below you will find some of the *main* automated tests covering the arithmetic circuits, prover, and verifier code.  It is **not** an exhaustive list of every `#[test]` function, but a subset of those that validate correctness of the constraint systems, witness generation, proof production, and on-chain verifier skeletons.

> To run any of the tests below, use Cargo’s standard interface, e.g.:
> ```bash
> cargo test -p opcode_tests jalr::test_jalr_op   # Example of single opcode test
> ```

## 1. Opcode-level functional tests (`opcode_tests` crate)

**Location**: [`circuit_defs/opcode_tests/`](../circuit_defs/opcode_tests/).

**Purpose**: Ensure that the full-machine circuit correctly compiles every RISC-V instruction.

How it works:
1. Runs the reference RISC-V simulator for a *single instruction* with randomized register/memory state.
2. Generates a witness for the *same* step using the circuit.
3. Compares resulting register values, memory reads/writes, PC updates, etc.

Highlights:
- 40+ individual tests (`src/opcodes/*.rs`) – one per opcode (`add.rs`, `lb.rs`, `jal.rs`, …), each containing a `test_<opcode>` function.
- Additional tests in `src/lib.rs` (`test_single_opcode`, `broken_tests`, etc.) gather multiple opcodes.
- Can be run with: `cargo test -p opcode_tests --profile test-release`.
These tests provide **completeness coverage** – if an opcode is incorrectly constrained, the comparison with the simulator will fail.

## 2. Program-level prover & delegation tests (`prover` crate)

**Location**: [`prover/src/tests/`](../prover/src/tests/)

**Purpose**: Exercise the *entire* STARK proving pipeline, through witness generation, to proof creation and verification on small RISC-V programs and cryptographic delegation gadgets.

How it works:
1. Embeds a short RISC-V binary or loads a `.bin` file.
2. Calls `run_test_for_binary(...)` which: 
   - Executes the program in the reference simulator.
   - Synthesizes the corresponding witness.  
   - Generates a proof.  
   - Immediately verifies it.
3. For delegation circuits, a specialized helper `run_basic_delegation_test_impl(...)` performs the same end-to-end cycle.

Representative tests:
- **`test_blake2_single_round`** – validates the BLAKE2 compression round delegation against known test-vectors.
- **`test_extended_blake2_single_round`** – covers the extended BLAKE2 state transformation.
- **`test_bigint_with_control_call`** – 256-bit arithmetic with the additional control selectors.
- **`multiple_instances_test`** – runs batches of tiny programs (Fibonacci, arithmetic, jumps) to check that batched proof generation/verification works.
- **`gpu_prover::basic_test`** – produces the same proof on CPU *and* GPU.

Run with:
```bash
cargo test -p prover                
cargo test -p prover test_blake2_single_round
```

Why it matters: Sits one level *above* opcode-unit tests and therefore catches integration issues across the simulator, constraint system, commitment scheme, and recursion layers.

## 3. Verifier-side skeleton tests (`verifier` and friends)

Crates:
* `verifier`
* `circuit_defs/*/verifier` (one per machine configuration & delegation gadget)

Key files: [`verifier/src/tests.rs`](../verifier/src/tests.rs), plus duplicated copies generated for each machine config.

There are usually two flavours:
- **`test_full_machine_verifier_out_of_simulator`** / `test_reduced_machine_verifier_out_of_simulator` – run the verifier directly in a Rust thread.
- **`test_verifier_in_simulator`** – cross-compile the verifier skeleton into a RISC-V ELF, then run it *inside* the cycle-accurate simulator.

Running example:
```bash
cargo test -p verifier test_full_machine_verifier_out_of_simulator -- --nocapture
```

These tests are heavier – they perform full Merkle verifications and FRI checks – but are essential to guarantee that proofs generated by the prover will be accepted on-chain.

## 4. FFT & Field arithmetic correctness 

Examples:
| Crate | File | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `fft` | [`src/row_major/tests.rs`](../fft/src/row_major/tests.rs) & several functions marked `#[test]` in [`src/grinded_fft/*`](../fft/src/grinded_fft) | Validate NTT/FFT forward & inverse consistency, coset conversions, butterfly kernels, etc. |
| `field` | (many small `#[test]` items inline) | Check field arithmetic, inversion, serialization, randomness, etc. |

Run with:
```bash
cargo test -p fft   
```

---

## 5. Prover integration tests (`prover_examples`)

Crate [**`circuit_defs/prover_examples`**](../circuit_defs/prover_examples) contains:
1. Runs the full staged prover pipeline.
2. Optionally serialises the resulting proof for later use by verifier tests.

Because it exercises **all** prover stages together, it's almost an end-to-end check.  It is **slow**.
