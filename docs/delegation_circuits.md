# Delegation circuits
## What is a delegation circuit?

A *delegation circuit* is a specialized gadget executed outside the main RISC-V semantics but still inside the same proving system, it can also be called 'precompile circuit'. The program issues a delegation request, the circuit builder materializes a small sub-circuit to process that request, together with formal register and memory accesses that integrate into the unified memory/register argument.
* **Creation**: `get_delegation_circuit()` builds and compiles a specific delegation circuit (e.g., BLAKE2 or BigInt), then returns a `DelegationProcessorDescription` containing its delegation_type (CSR ID), `trace_len`, `num_requests_per_circuit`, the circuit's `table_driver` (lookup tables), and the compiled circuit artifact. 
* **Access specification**: The circuit defines which registers are read/written and which memory words are accessed indirectly via base registers.
* **Integration**: All register/memory accesses are recorded just like main RISC-V circuit accesses and enforced in Stage 2/3 alongside the rest of the system.

One **delegation request** is a small primitive, not a full workflow. A complete high‑level operation, such as a full hash or multi‑step u256 flow, typically spans multiple delegation requests. Our current implementations include:
- BLAKE2: Full hashing over multiple rounds and/or blocks requires multiple requests, typically in a loop over rounds/blocks.
- BigInt (`u256`): A request performs one selected operation (`ADD`/`SUB`/`MUL_LOW`/`MUL_HIGH`/`EQ`/`MEMCOPY`) on a single 256‑bit pair. Larger transformations require multiple requests.

Currently, in our system, we have three delegation circuits implemented: 
- BLAKE2 round with extended control — [`cs/src/delegation/blake2_round_with_extended_control/mod.rs`](../cs/src/delegation/blake2_round_with_extended_control/mod.rs).
  - Used in: Prover recursion commitments and Merkle tree hashing.
- BLAKE2 single round — [`cs/src/delegation/blake2_single_round/mod.rs`](../cs/src/delegation/blake2_single_round/mod.rs).
  - Used in: Experiments/tests. Not enabled by default in setups.
- BigInt (u256) ops with control — [`cs/src/delegation/bigint_with_control/mod.rs`](../cs/src/delegation/bigint_with_control/mod.rs).
  - Used in: ZKsync OS as a BN254 math primitive (256-bit field ops; `ADD`/`SUB`/`MUL`/`EQ`, `carry`, `memcopy`).

### BLAKE2 single round
A fast cryptographic hash function built from add/xor/rotate G rounds over 32-bit words, it achieves high performance on CPUs and GPUs, keeping Merkle commitments and recursion fast. The function is circuit-friendly, as its operations decompose into simple XOR/bitwise lookups and additions, making it efficient as a delegation circuit, and it produces compact 256-bit outputs suitable for commitments.

Integration is simple and deterministic, not requiring a trusted setup.
Defined in [`cs/src/delegation/blake2_single_round/mod.rs`](../cs/src/delegation/blake2_single_round/mod.rs).

 **Memory ABI**
  - 16 state words `[R/W]`
  - 16 message words `[R]`
  - 1 word `round_bitmask` (read), boolean-split into ≤10 bits

**Tables used**: `Xor`, `Xor3`, `Xor4`, `Xor7`, `Xor9`.

If during the first round, `round_bitmask[0]` is set, it overwrites the state indices `[8,9,10,11,13,15]` with IV words. Message words are permuted via `SIGMAS` and the output state is written back.

### BigInt (`u256`) ops with control

Defined in [`cs/src/delegation/bigint_with_control/mod.rs`](../cs/src/delegation/bigint_with_control/mod.rs).

 **Registers**
  - **`x10`**: Pointer to U256 `a` (8×32-bit words). Creates 8 indirect `[R/W]` accesses with alignment $2^5$.
  - **`x11`**: Pointer to U256 `b` (8×32-bit words). Creates 8 indirect `[R]` accesses with alignment $2^5$.
  - **`x12`**: `control_mask` (read), boolean-split into 8 bits: `ADD`, `SUB`, `SUB_AND_NEGATE`, `MUL_LOW`, `MUL_HIGH`, `EQ`, `CARRY`, `MEMCOPY`. Exactly one operation bit must be `1` at a time; `CARRY` is a separate flag that may be set together with `ADD` or `SUB`.

**Tables used**: `U16SplitAsBytes`, `RangeCheck9x9`, `RangeCheck10x10`, `RangeCheck11`, `RangeCheck12`, `RangeCheck13`.

Results are written back to `a` (via writes at `x10`). If the delegation is not executed, ABI mandates zero writes.

### BLAKE2 round with extended control

Defined in [`cs/src/delegation/blake2_round_with_extended_control/mod.rs`](../cs/src/delegation/blake2_round_with_extended_control/mod.rs).

**Registers**
  - **`x10`**: Pointer to state + extended state. Creates 24 indirect [R/W] accesses with alignment $2^7$.
  - **`x11`**: Pointer to message words. Creates 16 indirect [R] accesses with alignment $2^2$.
  - **`x12`**: `round_bitmask` (read), boolean-split into ≤10 bits.
  - **`x13`**: `control_mask` (read), boolean-split into 3 bits (includes `LAST_ROUND`, `INPUT_IS_RIGHT_NODE`).

**Tables used**: `Xor`, `Xor3`, `Xor4`, `Xor7`, `Xor9` for compact bitwise arithmetic.

#### How it differs from BLAKE2 single round

- Extended control: 
  - `x10` state + extended (24 words, `[R/W]`, align $2^7$)
  - `x11` message (16 words, [R], align $2^2$)
  - `x12` `round_bitmask` (≤10 bits)
  - `x13` `control_mask` (3 bits incl. `LAST_ROUND`, `INPUT_IS_RIGHT_NODE`).
- Single round: memory-only ABI — 16 state `[R/W]`, 16 message `[R]`, 1 `round_bitmask`. No extended state, no control mask, no register-indirect accesses.

## Why “indirect access”?

*Indirect* means that memory is accessed via an address held in a register (a pointer) rather than by direct register file read/write. The circuit constructs formal memory queries from `(base pointer register, offset, alignment)` and feeds them into the global memory argument.

- **Direct access**: Read/write the architectural register file.
- **Indirect access**: Read/write RAM at an address computed from a base register (`x10`/`x11`) plus offsets. In code: `create_register_and_indirect_memory_accesses(...)` returns a register access plus a list of indirect reads/writes.

## Multiplicity and padding

Multiplicity 0 rows (padding): All columns that participate in the unified memory/register and lookup arguments are zeroed on rows that exist only for padding. This is enforced during Stage 3. Circuits must, therefore, be satisfiable when presented with all‑zero inputs on those rows.

- BLAKE2, both single round and extended control: These circuits read all inputs (state, message, round/control masks) through the unified memory/register interface. On multiplicity 0 rows, those sources are zero, and all selectors are zero. The Blake constraints are built to be zero‑preserving under zero inputs and zero selectors, so outputs remain zero without needing to multiply every relation by an `execute` flag. 
- BigInt with control: It derives booleans such as equality flags that could otherwise evaluate to `1` on all‑zero inputs. To avoid asserting non‑zero signals on padding rows, it masks such derived flags with the `execute` predicate obtained from `cs.process_delegation_request()` (see [`cs/src/delegation/bigint_with_control/mod.rs`](../cs/src/delegation/bigint_with_control/mod.rs)).

This uniform handling ensures that delegation circuits agree with padding/zeroing constraints. On rows with multiplicity 0, the inputs are zero, the derived selectors are zero, and outputs are zero, thereby keeping the circuit satisfiable.
